# 🤖RAG-fairness

## 📌Project Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant document from external knowledge sources. Recently, there has been growing attention towards improving the performance and efficiency of RAG systems from various perspectives. While these advancements have yielded significant results, the application of RAG in domains with considerable societal implications raises a critical question about fairness: **What impact does the introduction of the RAG paradigm have on the fairness of LLMs?** 

To address this question, we conduct extensive experiments by varying the LLMs, retrievers, and retrieval sources. Our experimental analysis reveals that the scale of the LLMs plays a significant role in influencing fairness outcomes within the RAG framework. For small-scale LLMs (e.g., Llama3.2-1b, Mistral-7b, and Llama3-8b), the integration of retrieval mechanisms often exacerbates unfairness. 


To mitigate the fairness issues introduced by RAG for small-scale LLMs, we propose two approaches, FairFT and FairFilter. Specifically, in FairFT, we align the retriever with the LLM in terms of fairness, enabling it to retrieve documents that facilitate fairer model outputs. In FairFilter, we propose a fairness filtering mechanism to filter out biased content after retrieval. Finally, we validate our proposed approaches on real-world datasets, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving fairness while maintaining performance.

### ⚖️Fairness Evaluation

- **Data Download and Processing:** Provides two types of retrieval libraries, WebPage and Wikipedia, along with the fairness evaluation dataset TrustLLM and utility evaluation dataset CRAG.
- **Retriever:** Includes both sparse retrievers (BM25) and dense retrievers supported by transformers.
- **LLM:** Supports closed-source models like GPT, GLM, Gemini, and other open-source models.
- **Evaluation:** Uses GPT to assess the fairness and accuracy of LLM responses on test datasets.

### 🛠️Fairness Improvement

- **fairFilter:** Adds a filter component between the retriever and LLM to exclude biased documents, reducing the impact of unfair or irrelevant documents on generation quality.
- **fairFT:** Trains retrievers using the ReplugLSR method to align with LLM preferences in terms of fairness, aiming to retrieve documents that make LLM responses fairer.
